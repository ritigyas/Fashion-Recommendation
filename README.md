# Fashion Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Fashion Recommendation System implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes machine learning techniques to recommend fashion items based on user preferences and historical data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Cleans and transforms raw fashion datasets into a structured format suitable for machine learning models.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user-item interactions to recommend fashion items based on similar users' preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends fashion items by analyzing product attributes and matching them to user preferences.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Model:** Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **Machine Learning-Based Recommendations:** Employs machine learning techniques to predict and suggest fashion items.
- **Visualization of Recommendations:** Provides graphical insights into recommendations using data visualization tools.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifies and suggests trending fashion items based on popular user interactions.
- **Personalization:** Adapts recommendations based on individual user behavior and historical preferences.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Implements accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess recommendation performance.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the recommendation model.
3. Generate fashion recommendations for users.
4. Visualize results and analyze performance.

## Dataset
The project requires a dataset of fashion items and user interactions. Ensure that the dataset is available in the working directory.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with an API for real-time recommendations.
- Enhancement of the recommendation algorithm using deep learning.
- Deployment as a web application.
